# String Mapping: 14_optimizer.py to 14_prompt+response.txt

## Mapping Format

Maps code snippets and values from the Python script to their corresponding outputs in the prompt+response file.

## Mappings

Mappings show how Python script strings are transformed by DSPy into prompt components. The BootstrapFewShot optimizer selects optimal demonstrations from the training set to include in the prompt based on the metric function.
